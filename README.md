# Palindrome_2
This project is another implementation of the Palindrome_1 project, to detect if a number is Palindome using Reverse/Add algorithm.
The difference is that in this implementation the number is reversed by a mathematical approach instead of using  a Stack, 
which makes it more suitableonly for numeric inputs only. However, it has the same functionality as the other Palindome project.
